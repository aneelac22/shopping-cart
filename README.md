# This is an example of Shopping Cart with discount feature added using Redux

A fruit shopping cart is taken as an example.

The cart can contain any item multiple times until the inventory (100 of each) is empty for the chosen product

The receipt will display:

    • the shopping list with a subtotal

    • the list of discounts by item

    • the total after discount

Items are priced as follows (showing discount when available):

    • Apples are 60 cents each

    • Oranges are 25 cents each

# Redux Shopping cart Example

This project template was built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which provides a simple way to start React projects with no build configuration needed.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

### `npm run build` or `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
